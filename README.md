# GesturePredict
Predicting hand gestures (EKG data) using machine learning

I had some EKG data taken by hand bracelete. 100 samples. 10 samples for each gesture. The goal was to normalize the data and apply machine learning algorithms to predict a gesture by its EKG.

# Instruments:
Python, Jupyter Notebook
pandas - working with data
thinkDSP - processing spectres of EKG 
skicit - machine learning

# Result: 
The project is not finished, but some good results are already achieved. Average accuracy 80% for train set!
